~~### Issue 1: Project Setup and Repository Structure~~
**Description:**  
- **Repository Layout:**  
  - Create a clear project structure with directories such as `/src` for core code and `/tests` for unit/integration tests.  
  - Include configuration files like `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`, `.gitignore`, and environment setup files (e.g., for virtual environments).  
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing and build workflows.  
- **Branching Strategy:**  
  - Define branch policies (e.g., main for production, develop for integration, feature branches for new work).

**Tags:** `setup`, `initial`  
**Milestone:** *v0.1 Initial Release*

~~### Issue 2: API Design and SQL-Style CRUD Specification~~
**Description:**  
- **High-Level API:**  
  - Define a primary class (e.g., `DictDB`) that represents the in-memory database.  
- **SQL Mapping:**  
  - Map SQL operations to Python methods:  
    - **INSERT:** `insert_record(record: dict)` – Add a new record.  
    - **SELECT:** `select_records(columns: list = None, where: callable = None)` – Retrieve records with optional projections and filtering, emulating SQL’s `SELECT` with a `WHERE` clause.  
    - **UPDATE:** `update_records(changes: dict, where: callable = None)` – Modify records that meet specified conditions.  
    - **DELETE:** `delete_records(where: callable = None)` – Remove records based on a condition.  
- **Error Handling & Constraints:**  
  - Specify error types for constraint violations (e.g., duplicate keys) similar to SQL’s integrity errors.  
  - Define behavior for edge cases (e.g., no record matches, ambiguous queries).

**Milestone:** *v0.1 Initial Release*

~~### Issue 3: Core SQL-Style CRUD Operations Implementation~~
**Description:**  
- **INSERT Operation:**  
  - Implement record insertion with schema validation (if a schema is defined).  
  - Validate uniqueness or other constraints before insertion.  
- **SELECT Operation:**  
  - Develop a query engine that supports SQL-like filtering (e.g., `WHERE` clause as a lambda or function).  
  - Support projections (selecting specific keys) and wildcard selection (`SELECT *`).  
- **UPDATE Operation:**  
  - Enable record modifications by applying user-defined conditions.  
  - Ensure atomicity where possible so that partial updates are avoided.  
- **DELETE Operation:**  
  - Remove records based on a filter condition, with safety checks to prevent accidental mass deletions.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Develop unit tests for normal operations, edge cases, and SQL-like behavior consistency.

### Issue 4: SQL Query Parser and Execution Engine
**Description:**  
- **Parser Development:**  
  - Design a lightweight SQL parser that converts SQL-like strings into executable operations on the dictionary.  
  - **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenize input strings into keywords (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), fields, and conditions.  
  - **Syntax Parsing:** Build an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the SQL command.  
- **Execution Engine:**  
  - Map parsed AST components to the corresponding `DictDB` methods.  
  - Validate queries and return detailed error messages for syntax or semantic errors.  
- **Scope:**  
  - Initially support a subset of SQL (e.g., basic SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) with WHERE clause conditions.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Write comprehensive tests with various SQL queries to ensure correct parsing and execution.

**Milestone:** *v0.2 Query Support*

### Issue 5: Transaction Management and Concurrency Control
**Description:**  
- **Transaction Layer:**  
  - Implement methods to begin, commit, and roll back transactions:  
    - `begin_transaction()`, `commit_transaction()`, and `rollback_transaction()`.  
- **Atomicity & Isolation:**  
  - Ensure that a batch of SQL-like operations (e.g., multiple INSERT/UPDATE statements) can be treated as a single atomic unit.  
  - Consider implementing a simple locking mechanism or using optimistic concurrency control to prevent conflicts during concurrent operations.  
- **Logging & Recovery:**  
  - Record operations during a transaction for easier rollback and debugging.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Develop tests that simulate concurrent access and verify that transactions maintain data integrity.

**Milestone:** *v0.4 Transactions and Concurrency*

~~### Issue 6: Indexing and Performance Optimization~~
**Description:**  
- **Index Design:**  
  - Allow users to create indexes on specific dictionary keys to accelerate SELECT queries.  
  - Implement automatic index updates on INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.  
- **Data Structures:**  
  - Evaluate and use efficient data structures (e.g., hash maps, B-trees) for maintaining indices.  
- **Benchmarking:**  
  - Benchmark query performance with and without indexing on larger datasets.  
  - Optimize indexing algorithms based on profiling results.  
- **Fallback Mechanisms:**  
  - Ensure that if index creation fails, the system continues to operate correctly using full scans.

~~### Issue 7: Persistence and Serialization Mechanism~~
**Description:**  
- **Save/Load Operations:**  
  - Implement methods such as `save_database(filename: str, format: str)` and `load_database(filename: str, format: str)` to persist the in-memory state.  
- **Supported Formats:**  
  - Support multiple formats like JSON for readability and pickle for speed and efficiency.  
- **Backup & Recovery:**  
  - Design an automatic backup system that saves the current state periodically or after significant changes.  
- **Non-Blocking I/O:**  
  - Ensure that save/load operations do not block ongoing database operations by considering asynchronous I/O or background processes.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Validate that the database state remains consistent across multiple save/load cycles.

~~### Issue 8: Error Handling, Logging, and SQL Error Emulation~~
**Description:**  
- **Standardized Errors:**  
  - Define custom exception classes that mimic SQL error codes (e.g., integrity constraint violations, syntax errors).  
- **Logging Framework:**  
  - Integrate Python’s logging module to capture detailed logs of query executions, transactions, and error events.  
  - Allow users to configure log levels and outputs (console, file, etc.).  
- **Error Reporting:**  
  - Ensure that the SQL parser and CRUD operations return clear, actionable error messages to the user, similar to traditional SQL databases.  
- **Testing:**  
  - Simulate various error conditions (malformed queries, invalid data) and verify that error handling behaves as expected.

- **Automated Testing:**  
  - Ensure that tests, linting, and code coverage checks are part of the CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.  
- **Release Workflow:**  
  - Automate the release process, including tagging and publishing to PyPI.
